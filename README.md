I build a product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible from frontendmentor.io 
Challenge: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa


users are able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
